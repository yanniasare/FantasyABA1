                                        <h5>Choosing Your Line-Up</h5>
                                        <p>From your 10 player roster, select 5 players by the Gameday deadline to form your starting line-up.</p>
                                        <p>All your points for the Gameday will be scored by these 5 players, however if one or more doesn't play they may be automatically substituted.</p>
                                        <p>Your team can play in one of two formations:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>2 Back Court and 3 Front Court</li>
                                            <li>3 Back Court and 2 Front Court</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <h5>Selecting a Captain and a Vice-Captain</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            From your starting 5, nominate a captain and vice-captain. Your captain's score will be doubled.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>If your captain plays 0 minutes in the Gameday, then your vice captainâ€™s score will be doubled (providing they play at least 1 minute).</p>
                                        <p>If both the captain and the vice-captain do not play in any games in a Gameday, the bonus will be lost. No other player will take over the captaincy in their place.</p>

                                        <h5>Prioritising Your Bench For Automatic Substitutions</h5>
                                        <p>Your bench provides cover for unforeseen events like injuries and postponements by automatically replacing starting players who don't play in a Gameday.</p>
                                        <p>Playing in a Gameday means playing at least 1 minute. Based on the priorities you assign, automatic substitutions are processed at 11 PM GMT, after the last game of the Gameday has finished.</p>
                                        <p>If any of your players don't play in the Gameday, they will be substituted by the highest priority bench player who played in the Gameday and doesn't break the formation rules (e.g., If your starting team has 2 Back Court players, a Back Court player can only be replaced by another Back Court player).</p>

                                        <p>After selecting your roster, you can sign and waive players in the transfers tab. Unlimited transfers can be made at no cost until your first deadline.</p>
                                        <p>After your first deadline you will receive 2 free transfers each Gameweek.</p>
                                        <p>Each additional transfer you make in the same Gameweek will deduct 100 points from your total score at the next deadline.</p>
                                        <p>If you do not use any of your free transfers, you are able to make an additional free transfer the following Gameweek. If you do not use this saved free
                                            transfer in the following Gameweek, it will be carried over until you do. You can never have more than 1 saved transfer.</p>

                                        <h5>Wildcards</h5>

                                        <p>A wildcard allows a user to make unlimited transfers in a Gameday, free of charge. Any transfers already made that Gameday will also be free. 
                                            The Wildcard chip is played when confirming transfers that cost points and can't be cancelled once played.</p>
                                        <p>Please note that when playing a wildcard, any saved free transfers will be lost.</p>
                                        <p>E.g., if you have 3 free transfers before using your wildcard, you will only have 2 remaining for the rest of the gameweek.</p>
                                        <p>If you play your wildcard and donâ€™t use another free transfer in that gameweek, you will still be eligible for a saved free transfer for the following Gameweek.</p>

                                        <h5>Player Salaries</h5>

                                        <p>Player salaries change during the season depending on the popularity of the player in the transfers tab. Player salaries do not change until the season starts.</p>
                                        <p>The salary shown on your transfers page is a player's selling salary.</p>
                                        <p>This selling salary may be less than the player's current purchase salary as a sell-on fee of 50% (Rounded up to the nearest $0.1m) will be applied on any profits made on that player.</p>
                                        <p>The player salaries featured in the game are not reflective of real NBA salaries and are for gameplay purposes only.</p>
